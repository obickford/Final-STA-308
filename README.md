# STA-308-Final

  The coefficient of variation takes the population standard deviation divided by the population mean to get the coefficient. It measures the frequency of a variable and how the variables are dispersed around the mean and its variability. 


  In the data, the Midwest and South regions have a similar mean/average where the Midwest is 1.34 and the South is 1.54. The Northeast and West have similar averages where the Northeast is 2.11 and the West is 2.15. While all are around a similar average, there are regions that have closer average than others. However with the coefficients of variation, the South had the lowest at 31.64%, then the Midwest at 34.44%, then Northeast at 35.32%, then with the highest was the West at 42.37%. 
  The West had the highest percentage of points dispersed around the mean of 2.15. This means that most of the rates of change of unemployment for the West region between 2021 and 2022 were around 2.15. The lowest, the South had only 31.64% of the points dispersed around the mean of 1.54. There was more variation with the unemployment rates in the South from 2021 to 2022. While the South was not the lowest mean, it ended up having the lowest coefficient of variation.
